-> Difference between list and tuple

 => list is a collection data type which is contain similar and dis-similar data element
   list which is represent by [] braces when tuple is a collection data type and which contain similar and dis similar 
   data element but which is represented by () braces

=> list which is mutable (we can change it value )   - we can perfom append , insert , remove all opretions but same way 

=>  tuple is a inmutable ( we can't change it value ) - we can't perfom appond , insert , remove all opretions but same way


=>  list is slower than tuple 

    and tuple is faster than list
